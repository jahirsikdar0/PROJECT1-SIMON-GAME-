## Overview

Let's start out with something fun - a game

Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges - it's up to you to use what you've learned to come up with a fun and interesting game.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go.

As part of this project, you'll be required to create a project presentation that you will use to present your work at the end of project week. Your goal for this presentation is to extract the most important aspects of what went into building your project into easy-to-use language and practice speaking and presenting about your code.

Show us what you've got!

## Requirements
Your project has 3 required parts: the app, a README markdown file, and a presentation

#### Constraints :no_entry_sign::

- Collision detection games are NOT allowed (oooo controversial!)</br>
  ***Note:*** </br>
  >If you are super set on doing a collision game, you may petition to do one. This petition involves either a working collision example that you have previously made OR an **in depth**, **highly technical** written statement explaining the collision logic you plan on using.
- HTML Canvas based games are NOT allowed.
- 3rd party CSS Frameworks are NOT allowed.

#### Your app must :computer::

- Have two pages: a landing page and a game page
	- Landing page:
		- With the name of your game, instructions, and a start button.
	- Game page:
		- Should contain the actual game.
- Use only jQuery for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online to GitHub pages - (We will be going over how to do this later this week)
- Include at least one CSS transition fired by a DOM event
- Style your landing page and game page with class-based external CSS file (*inline styles are not allowed*)
- Use media queries to make your pages responsive
- Use flexbox to build your grid system
- Create and get approval for a wireframe for your project
- Comment your code appropriately
- Adhere to the [AirBnB style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for writing your JavaScript
- Adhere to the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.xml) for writing your HTML/CSS

	***Note***</br>
	>If you're creating a two (or more)-player game, you must allow players to take turns and design logic for winning & visually display which player won

#### Your README.md file must include :memo::
* Explanations of the technologies used
* Wireframes
* The approach taken
* Installation instructions _(if needed)_
* Unsolved problems
* Any other useful information about your app

#### Your presentation will consist of :speech_balloon::
- **5 minutes:** A presentation deck _- Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint_
  - At least 5 slides
  - Use easy-to-understand language and avoid too much "technical" terminology
  - Include wireframes that shows your game and landing page
  - Answer the following questions:
	 - What is the game about?
	 - What features did include?
	 - Were there any constraints you had to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)
	 - Is there any other information you think might help us (your stakeholders) understand what you've built?
- **2 minutes:** A demo of your game
  - Show the functionality of your game!

***Note***</br>
>We **will** cut you off after the given amounts of time. Likewise if you are *way* under your time, we **will** tell you to stand there until your time is done, so don't skimp out. Plan your presentation accordingly. Practice it!

#### Bonus :tada::
- If this is a one-player game, design logic for winning and visually display score
- Include at least one animation using SVG
- Include a "Tutorial Section"
- Use a form to collect information about the user on the landing and display that information on the game page.

## Necessary Deliverables

**For the app:**

* A working game, built by you, hosted on GitHub Pages
* A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted game (*A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your GitHub repo*), and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project

**For the README:**

* Create a README.md that includes the requirements above _(in the presentation requirements section)_.

**For the presentation:**

* Create a 5 minute presentation deck - Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint - of at least 5 slides that answers the questions above _(in the presentation requirements section)_.
* Demo your game!

## Suggested Ways to Get Started :checkered_flag:

* Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* Consult documentation resources (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
